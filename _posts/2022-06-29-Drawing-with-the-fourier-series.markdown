The Fourier series is the idea that any given function can be represented by a sum of sinusoids with varying amplitudes and frequencies. In particular,  sin and cosine. 

Firstly, let's examine the properties of sine. A sine function has a period of 2$\pi$ and is an odd function. This means that when we create a sum of sine functions the resulting function will retain these properties - namely, continue to be a periodic and an odd function. 

The same applies for cosine.
