The Fourier series is the idea that any given function can be represented by a sum of sinusoids with varying amplitudes and frequencies. In particular,  sin and cosine. 

Firstly, let's examine the properties of cosine. A sine function has a period of $$ 2\pi $$ and is an even function. This means that when we create a sum of cosine functions the resulting function will retain these properties - namely, continue to be a periodic and an even function regardless of their amplitude or frequency. These sums can be represented as: 

 $$\displaystyle\sum_{n=1} ^{\infty} a_n \cos(nx)$$
 

The same can be applied for sine functions, however,they will be odd instead: 

 $$\displaystyle\sum_{n=1} ^{\infty} a_n \sin(nx)$$
